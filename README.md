# Air-Pollution-Visualization
This app is a tool for people with respitory problems (specifically people suffering from Asthma) who live in the 8 biggest cities of germany. They can use this app to check the air quality in different districts of the city. This could help them avoid restraining their longs.

## Overview
This project uses choropleth maps and an API (https://open-meteo.com/) to visualize real-time data about the air quality of the specified districts. The color of each district corresponds with the air quality of that district. Also by hovering on each district the user can get an accurate air quality value. This app uses the European AQI.


## Key User Group
The primary user group are people suffering from asthma who live in big cities and are in the risk of asthma attacks.


## User Objectives
Users of this application seek to:

* Understand the current air quality in specific locations.
* Determine whether it's safe to go outside without a mask.
* Plan outdoor activities based on real-time air pollution data.

## The chosen visualization
The chosen method is a map-based interface displaying color-coded air quality indices for different areas. This method is effective because:

* Intuitive Interpretation: Users can quickly interpret air quality levels through color gradients on the map.

* Geospatial Awareness: A map allows users to associate air quality with specific locations, helping them plan activities in safer areas.

* Real-time Updates: The map provides real-time updates, ensuring users have the latest information for decision-making.
